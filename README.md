# The lovely elisr sticker

This repo contains the elisr_vec.xcf image, the code to reproduce the sticker,
and the sticker itself. If you want to reproduce the sticker, convert *.xcf to
*.png (resolution: 2400 dpi). Name it 'elisr_vec.png'.  Put 'elisr_vec.png' in
the repo (you've downloaded) and finally, Run the code. That's it.
