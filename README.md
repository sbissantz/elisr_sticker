# The lovely elisr sticker <img src='elisr.png' align="right" height="300"/>

This repo contains the `elisr_vec.xcf` image, the code to reproduce the
sticker, and the sticker itself. If you want to reproduce it, convert `*.xcf`
to `*.png` (resolution: 2400 dpi). Name it `elisr_vec.png` and pack them all
together.  Run the code. That's it.
